       "\n",
       "2. **T-cell Markers**: The genes CD3D, CD3E, and IL7R are well-known markers for T-cells. CD3 is a part of the T-cell receptor complex, and IL7R is important for T-cell development and homeostasis. \n",

This suggests a role in immune response and antigen presentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **B Cell Markers**:\n",
       "   - Genes like **CD79A**, **CD79B**, **MS4A1** (also known as CD20), **FCRLA**, and **BLK** are well-known markers of B cells. They are involved in B cell receptor signaling and development.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Other Immune-Related Genes**:\n",
       "   - **CD74** is involved in MHC class II presentation and is often expressed in B cells and antigen-presenting cells.\n",
       "   - **TCL1A** is associated with T cell activation and has been implicated in B cell malignancies.\n",
       "   - **FCER2** (CD23) is a low-affinity IgE receptor expressed on B cells and is involved in B cell activation and regulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Additional Genes**:\n",
       "   - **BANK1** is involved in B cell signaling and is associated with autoimmune diseases.\n",
       "   - **HVCN1** is involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species in B cells.\n",
       "   - **LTB** (lymphotoxin beta) is important for lymphoid organ development and B cell function.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given this information, the genes you listed are indicative of **B cells**, particularly activated B cells or germinal center B cells, which are involved in the adaptive immune response. They may also represent a subset of B cells that are engaged in antigen presentation, possibly in the context of an immune response or in a disease state such as lymphoma or autoimmune disorders."
